	\section{Introduction}
	\textit{Deep Reinforcement Learning} is a huge step towards the creation of an universal artificial intelligence\footnote{can be used for multiple problems without notable changes}.
	In 2013 a company, owned by Google, called ''Deep Mind'', was able to create an astonishing implementation of RL\footnote{Reinforcement Learning}, which was capable to play a range of retro games of the console ''Atari 2600''.
	In many cases, the AI\footnote{Artificial Intelligence} was not only able to play the games successfully, but also exceeded human performances significantly \cite{atari}.
	After these impressive results, it is definitely worth to take a closer look at \textit{reinforcement learning}.\\	  
	Playing games is fun, but \textit{reinforcement learning} has more to offer, as discussed in \cite{usecasesRL}.
	Apart from playing video games, there are many use cases in fields like robotics, traffic control or even personalized advertisement.
	Apart from the Atari paper \cite{atari}, multiple papers have been written about RL.
	Some noteworthy examples are the creation of an RL algorithm, which recommends personalized news \cite{drn} or a survey about different applications for RL in robotics \cite{roboticsRL}. While supervised and unsupervised learning are already widely used in production, \textit{reinforcement learning} is still in development and further research is needed.
	As an interesting topic with many application possibilities, there is a demand for tutorials and hands-on guides for beginners, especially students.
	Beginners often struggle to find a good starting point into the world of AI and specifically RL.
	Many existing tutorials are written for more advanced users, who already have a deeper understanding of machine learning.\\
	For this reason, the \textit{''Deep Reinforcement Learning Beginners Tutorial''} was created, as an effort to create an easy to understand, hands-on guide to learn RL without needing extensive knowledge about \textit{machine learning}.
	After completing the tutorial, the reader will be familiar with the basics of RL and be able to create its own implementation based on the examples given.\\
	This document serves as a documentation of the making and thought-process of the authors, as well as a presentation of the result and a critical reflection of the work.
	First, the basic contents of the tutorial will be explained, to give the reader a short overview about the topic of RL.
	Then, the initial targets will be outlined as well as the methods and materials, that were used in the making.
	Finally, all results will be presented and evaluated against the initial targets. 
	This document will be concluded by the discussion of possible improvements and expansions of the final product.

		As we discussed before, Reinforcement Learning can be used to solve a range of different problems. Developing Machine Learning algorithms is often not easy to understand nor comprehensible especially for beginners. Furthermore, it is important to be able to compare the performance of different iterations of our algorithm, to be able to improve it.
		
		So bascially we need an environment, that we can use to test and train our RL agent, which fulfills the following requirements:
		
		repeatable test/training epochs
		finite set of inputs
		finite set of actions
		easy state representation
		easy to control agent
		deliver a score for a given state
		
		In practice, not all of these points will be fulfilled, but as this is a beginners guide, we will start with a simple environment. Luckily, many video games can be used as quite good environments for machine learning purposes. Many implementations of RL are tested with games as Benchmark and there are some good reasons for this. Developing a whole test environment would be labour intensive and would require dedicated work towards a useable simulator. Using an existing game is also easier to compare to human performance and therefore the evaluation of different algorithms is easier. Another important point is the size of possible inputs and actions. The AI replaces the human player. Depending on the game, the input for our agent is an image, like a human player would see it. The set of actions is a combination of different buttons, which can be pressed on a controller. Finally, games are fun and most people can relate to them. It is also easier to understand what we want to accomplish, because we can transfer aspects from our human play style to the behaviour of an AI.
