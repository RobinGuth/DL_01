\section{Introduction}
Deep Reinforcement Learning (also called RL) is a huge step towards the creation of an universal artificial intelligence.\\ %TODO ADD SOME SPICE
This guide will lead the reader through the setup process for the beginner tutorial "Deep Reinforcement Learning". 
The user will get to know basic concepts of RL with the help of:
\begin{description}
	\item[Python3] One of the most popular programming languages for deep learning. The following tutorials will be based on Python. See \url{https://www.python.org/} for more information.
	\item[Jupyter Lab] 
	\item[Google Cloud] Cloud based processing power for training of different implementations of RL. Delivers a linux environment with preinstalled utilities for deep learning including different libraries for Python, Python itself and Jupyter Lab.
